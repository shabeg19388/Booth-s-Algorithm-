# Booth-s-Algorithm-
This project required me to implement the Booth's algorithm of multiplication. I have implemented the same in java. 
The input:-
“Enter multiplicand in decimal representation:”
**multiplicand**
“Enter multiplier in decimal representation:”
**multiplier*
The output is of the form:-
“Multiplicand in binary representation is: ​**multiplicand** ​”
“Multiplier in binary representation is: ​**multiplier**​ “
“Steps performed are:”
**** **** * **** **** *
**** **** * **** **** *
“Result in signed bit magnitude is:”
**result**
“Result in decimal is:”
**result**
